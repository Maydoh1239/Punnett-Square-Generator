# Punnet Square Generator

This program makes punnet squares using python 3 and Pillow.
Supports any number of genes, so long as your computer is powerful enough (and python doesn't crash)
run the program, and input your parents. Colors are from red to purple (and back), depending on how recessive the gene is.
